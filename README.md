# gaze [![Build Status](https://github.com/heinop2rn/LiveQuest/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202017-06-21%20at%2008.55.07.png)](http://www.tlu.ee/~anuxyo/LiveQuest/Webpage/VizTest/LQV.html) [![Build status]

## Info
- This software is developed during Tallinn University School of Digital Technologies Software development Summer project.

Our Add-on uses Learning Locker Storage, which is a open source data repository to store learning activity.
For storing data, it uses learning activity statements generated by xAPI (Tin Can).
Our Add-on captures Google Forms data using Tin Can and then sends to Learning Locker.
For visualizing we use D3, xAPI-Dashboard and xAPI-Wrapper.

## Features
- Send Google Forms data to Learning Locker using Tin Can API
- Tutorial website on http://www.tlu.ee/~anuxyo/LiveQuest/Webpage/VizTest/
- Visualization of Student Answers http://www.tlu.ee/~anuxyo/LiveQuest/Webpage/VizTest/graphs2.html
- Analyze collected data in Learning Locker
